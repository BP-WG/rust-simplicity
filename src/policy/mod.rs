//! # Function-like Expression Language
//! This language is similar to policy language in miniscript, but
//! whose target is simplicity instead of bitcoin Script. Policy
//!
//! # Simplicity Script Policies
//!
//! Tools for representing simplicity programs as spending policies.
//! These may be compiled to Simplicity programs.
//!
//! The format represents public keys abstractly to allow wallets to replace
